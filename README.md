# Introduction to Programming in C++

Welcome to my **Introduction to Programming** repository! ðŸš€  
This repository contains structured learning materials for programming, divided into **modules**. Each module follows a **progressive learning approach**, composed of:

- **A guided exercise** to introduce the concepts step by step.
- **Three unguided exercises** for practice and reinforcement.
- **An assignment** consisting of **two longer exercises**, allowing for deeper understanding and problem-solving.

## ðŸ“š Modules Overview

### âœ… [Module 1](Module1): Introduction to Programming  
This module covers the **basics of programming**, including:  
- Understanding fundamental concepts (variables, data types, basic operations).  
- Writing simple programs using input/output.  
- Practicing basic arithmetic and logical expressions.  

### âœ… [Module 2](Module2): Control Structures (1) - Conditional Statements  
This module introduces **conditional branching** (`if`, `else`, `else if`) and their usage to create **decision-making programs**. Topics include:  
- Writing programs that respond to user input.  
- Using boolean expressions and logical operators.  
- Structuring conditions to solve real-world problems.
