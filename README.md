# Introduction to Programming in C++

This repository contains my C++ programming exercises from the Coursera course [**Initiation Ã  la Programmation en C++**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/initiation-programmation-cpp), offered by EPFL (Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne).  

The purpose of this repository is to **showcase my progress** in learning C++ through structured exercises, covering essential programming concepts such as **variables, control structures, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming**.  
This repository is **not intended to provide free solutions** or facilitate plagiarism of the course content. It exists solely to demonstrate my **problem-solving skills** and **understanding of C++** to potential recruiters.  

## ðŸ“š Repository Structure  
Each module follows a structured learning approach, consisting of:  
- **A guided exercise** introducing core concepts.  
- **Three unguided exercises** for independent practice.  
- **An assignment** with **two longer problems** to reinforce learning.  

## ðŸ“˜ Modules Overview  

### âœ… [Module 1](Module1): Introduction to Programming  
This module covers **the fundamentals of programming**, including:  
- Understanding variables, data types, and basic operations.  
- Writing simple C++ programs with input/output.  
- Introduction to arithmetic and logical expressions.  

### âœ… [Module 2](Module2): Control Structures (1) - Conditional Statements  
This module focuses on **decision-making in C++**, including:  
- Using `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements.  
- Boolean expressions, logical operators, and their common pitfalls.  
- Structuring conditional logic to handle various cases.
